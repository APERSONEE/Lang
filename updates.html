            <div style="border:5px solid wheat; border-radius:15px; margin:15px; height:auto; width:70vw;">
                <h2 class="unlinkedHeader" style="color:wheat;">Lang 0.0.0+</h2>
                <img src="lang precursor.jpg">
                <p class="header" style="margin:80px;">This is the first iteration of Lang. It was written one night when our lead developer, Nate, was studying for a French test. The vocab was built-in and it had 2 modes- and ran in the terminal.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="unlinkedHeader" style="color:wheat;">Lang 1.0.0+</h2>
                <img src="og lang.jpg" style="width:40vw;">
                <p class="header" style="margin:80px;">This version of Lang was the first to have a GUI, or Graphic User Interface. This version was requested when Nate began sharing the program with friends. It still just included built-in verbs.</p>

                <h2 class="unlinkedHeader" style="color:wheat;">Lang 1.5.0+</h2>
                <img src="other/Lang 105.jpg" style="width:40vw;">
                <p class="header" style="margin:80px;">This version of Lang, while not a full new Major version, is important as it is the first to introduce the iconic Book Logo and Custom Studysheets.</p>

                <br>
                <h2 class="unlinkedHeader" style="color:wheat;">Lang 2.0.0+</h2>
                <img src="lang2.1.jpg" style="width:40vw;">
                <img src="lang2.2.jpg" style="width:40vw;">
                <p class="header" style="margin:80px;">The home page for Lang 2.0.0+ had 2 pages, you had to scroll down. While not being aesthetically appealing, Lang 2.0.0 introduced many revolutionary features to the site, including online saving of Studysheets and compatibility with Quizlet Sets.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="unlinkedHeader" style="color:wheat;">Lang 3.0.0+</h2>
                <img src="lang3.0.jpg" style="width:40vw;">
                <p class="header" style="margin:80px;">Lang 3.0.0 was the first version of Lang that was worked on by the full Lang team. This version was designed with users other than the developers in mind for the first time, and pushed account creation and usage.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2 class="unlinkedHeader" style="color:wheat;">Lang 3.5.0+</h2>
                <img src="other/Lang 350.jpg" style="width:40vw;">
                <p class="header" style="margin:80px;">Lang 3.5.0, while not a full Major version increase was the version of Lang that introduced the now-standard Lang popups to alert the users of various things. It also was the first to not have a dedicated Library page, and instead move all Lang Backend interactions onto the Homepage itself. </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2 class="unlinkedHeader" style="color:wheat;">Lang 4.0.0+</h2>
                <img src="other/Lang 4.0.png" style="width:40vw;">
                <p class="header" style="margin:80px;">Lang is currently on the 4th Major version. This version has an all-new sleek design, more information avaliable to the user, more storage for Studysheets, new modes, and extended compatibility with other sites.</p>

            <h2 style="color:wheat;">What do updates usually contain?</h2>
            <div style="border:5px solid wheat; border-radius:15px; margin:15px; height:auto; width:70vw;">
                <p class="header">Lang updates are <strong>automatically pushed to the server</strong> and you should not notice any down time. Updates can contain anything from bug fixes to total UI overhauls. The most common form of update, the routine update, typically contains bugfixes and maybe small UI tweaks, <strong>often requested by users. Make sure to use the feedback button on the Homepage to request a feature!</strong> These updates can come from week to week, and potentially day to day depending on how busy the devs are :). </p>

            <h2 style="color:wheat;">How are updates labeled?</h2>
            <div style="border:5px solid wheat; border-radius:15px; margin:15px; height:auto; width:70vw; padding:10px;">
                <p class="header">Lang updates are labeled specifically to make it easier for users and the Lang team to see what an update contains. There are 3 numbers in the label of a Lang update, as Lang uses the Major Minor Patch semantic versioning system. For example, we could say 3.4.2 is the semantic version number. The first number signifies the major version of Lang. We are currently on the 3rd major version of Lang (see below for previous versions). The differences between versions are huge and readily apparent. The second number (4, in our example) is the minor change, or for Lang, how many features were added from the start of the major version. The final number (2, in our example) is how many small bugfix/UI tweaks, or patches, were done since the start of a minor version. You can view update descriptions on GitHub, and you can always see the version number in settings.</p>
