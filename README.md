# Welcome to the GitHub repository for NWVBUG Development's Lang!

## Info
Tired of old, ad-filled, and boring study sessions? Lang is the site for you! Lang is not just for language classes, although it does excel in them. Lang allows you to make your own lists to study whatever language or topic you want. Review with flashcards, build memory with the writing mode, or take a practice test and be ready to get the A+. All of this and more, completely free and with no ads. Lang supports Quizlet Study Sets as well, giving it a huge library of pre-existing sets to pull from. Lang is extremely user customizable, from the user interface to the way the study algorithm is handled. Lang supports cloudsaving your studysheets, and as with all products produced by Lye Software companies it uses the proprietary and secure Lye Account system to do so. Lang Studysheets are saved in the proprietary .lang format to ensure that you can securely save your Studysheets to a local machine or upload them to the Lang Cloud to acces them wherever.
