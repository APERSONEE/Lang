# Lang

*Visit the website at www.nwvbug.com *


Lang is a project that i made to be an alternative to programs like Memrise and Quizlet. with a simple and customizable user interface and focus on verbs, it is good for studying. 

Lang is completely **free** and features **no ads**. 

Currently only French is supported with *preloaded* verbs, as that is the language i am taking right now. Past tense, present tense, and future tense all work for French.

**However, in addition to French, the user can make Custom Verb Sheets either manually on their PC, or using the Online Creator built into Lang.**

*How To Create Custom Verb Sheets:*


**Within Site:**


select the option of multi vs single verb


follow on screen prompts- put the infinitive verb in the correct box and the conjugations in the boxes adjacent to it.
Click "New Line" to add a new verb.
select Download to save the .txt file



**Manual:**
Create a .txt file (name does not matter).


input the verbs you want in this syntax:


mutli verbs
  [infinitive form, je, tu, il, nous, vous, ils]
  
  
  for example,
  [parler, parle, parles, parle, parlons, parlez, parlent]
  
  
single verbs
  [infinitive form, stem]
  
  
  for example,
  [être, avoir été]
  


*How to read verb sheets*


select whether it is single verb or mutli


Select the correct sheet


Click Upload and begin studying!



Potentially Upcoming Features:

These are some features that have been suggested for Lang. None of these are guaranteed to come, and not all are in development at the current time for one reason or another. However, I think that all of these have merit and am considering them to be added in the future. 

If you want to suggest one, go to Github Issues page and use the "Suggestion" tag.
