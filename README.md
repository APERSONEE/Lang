# Welcome to the GitHub repository for Lye Software's Lang!

## What is Lang?
Our lead developer, Nate Vemuri, once found himself cramming for a French test with a popular online studying program. 
As the seconds turned to minutes, turned to hours, he realized something. It was just too complicated to help him learn.
It's endless distractions, unnecessary features, and brightly colored UI kept him from retaining anything. 
Thus, Lang was built, originally a humble python script, but now a fully fledged web app.
                    
Lang's goal is to break free from the shackles of modern standards. 
While it has the ability to save to an account, we believe that you should own the software you use. 
Thus Lang does not require an active internet connection once the page is loaded, and study sheets can be saved offline to be transferred among apps. 
In addition, Lang disregards the model of the modern internet by using absolutely no tracking or analytics, even with a Lye account. 
Probably most importantly though, Lang is built with everything you need and nothing you don't. 
We took time to ensure the experience can be customized to your desire, without adding unnecessary options and bloat into the software. 
                
We hope that you enjoy using Lang just as much as we enjoy creating it.
And when the next test comes around, you'll find that with a little patience and a lot of Lang, you'll excel!
           
## What can it do?

Lang is not just for language classes, although it does excel in them. Lang allows you to make your own lists to study whatever language or topic you want. Review with flashcards, build memory with the writing mode, or take a practice test and be ready to get the A+. All of this and more, completely free and with no ads. Lang supports Quizlet Study Sets as well, giving it a huge library of pre-existing sets to pull from. Lang is extremely user customizable, from the user interface to the way the study algorithm is handled. Lang supports cloudsaving your studysheets, and as with all products produced by Lye Software companies it uses the proprietary and secure Lye Account system to do so. Lang Studysheets are saved in the proprietary .lang format to ensure that you can securely save your Studysheets to a local machine or upload them to the Lang Cloud to acces them wherever.
                
## How is it made?

Lang is made almost entirely in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Lang connects to 2 servers- the Lye Account System and Lang Cloud. Both of these are Python web servers.
