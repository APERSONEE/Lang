# Lang

*Visit the website at nwvbug.github.io/Lang/ *


Lang is a project that i made to be an alternative to programs like Memrise and Quizlet. with an extremely simple user interface and focus on verbs, it is good for studying. I am currently developing the ability to upload your own verbs so you are not stuck with the ones that I have put in there. 

Currently only French is supported with preloaded verbs, as that is the language i am taking right now. Past tense, present tense, and future tense all work for French.
