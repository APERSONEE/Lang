# Lang

*Visit the website at www.nwvbug.com *


Lang is a project that i made to be an alternative to programs like Memrise and Quizlet. with an extremely simple user interface and focus on verbs, it is good for studying. I am currently developing the ability to upload your own verbs so you are not stuck with the ones that I have put in there. 

Currently only French is supported with preloaded verbs, as that is the language i am taking right now. Past tense, present tense, and future tense all work for French.

*How To Create Custom Verb Sheets:*

**Manual:**
Create a .txt file (name does not matter).


input the verbs you want in this syntax:


mutli verbs
  [infinitive form, je, tu, il, nous, vous, ils]
  
  
  for example,
  [parler, parle, parles, parle, parlons, parlez, parlent]
